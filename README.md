# PenPlotter

Description

Our proposed design will utilize a radial arm rotating around a hub. The rotation
will be carried out by a wheel at the end of the arm, driven by a Pittperson Gearmotor. The wheel
will likely be a hobby wheel for RC cars that we will obtain from Zacsters. 
The pen carrier will be moved radially by a belt design. The belt will be obtained from 
Vex robotics. The belt will be driven by a Pittperson Gearmotor. The belt system will be supported by
rails which will consist of metal tubes that we hope to find around the Aero Hanger. 
The pen carrier will be raised and lowered using a hobby servo obtained from Zacsters. 
It will likely be an SG90 servo. The required brackets will be 3D printed at Mustang 60, 
which we believe is free. 

The system will be mounted in the top right corner of the paper with the Pittperson Gearmotor providing rotary motion. The rails that extend past the diameter of the 6 x 4 inch paper. The wheel will be mounted at the end of the rail system in order to avoid disrupting the paper. Between the rails will be the belt which will move radially between the two rails.
